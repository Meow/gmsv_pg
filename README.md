# Gmod Module C Wrapper
An ANSI C wrapper for Garry's Mod binary module interface. Designed for compatibility, speed and code maintainability as primary goals.

## Building
A premake5.lua file is included in the `/gmsv_example` folder. Please check it out and edit to suit your own project.

Configurations for both x86 and x86_64 (for upcoming gmod versions) are included.
